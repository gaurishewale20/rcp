# Railway Concession Portal

Currently our concession system is completely manual where the concerned authority and the students have to manually enter all the details. First we have to fill the form and then the concerned authority verifies the details of the student and then fills the actual form which is accepted by the railway authorities. Our system aims to digitalize this.

## Goals
- Streamline all the document-related process. 
- Reduce the reliance on manual processes.
- Move towards paperless administration.
